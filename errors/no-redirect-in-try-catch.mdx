title: No Redirect in Try-Catch
---

> Prevent usage of `redirect` in try-catch block.

## Why This Error Occurred

You attempted to use the `redirect` function within a try-catch block. When `redirect` is called, it throws a `NEXT_REDIRECT` error internally. If this error is caught by the catch block, it prevents the redirect from executing as intended.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Move the `redirect` call outside of the try-catch block. This ensures that the `NEXT_REDIRECT` error is not caught and the redirect can proceed without interference.

## Example

### Incorrect Usage:

```javascript
try {
  // some code that might throw an error
  redirect('/some-path')
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
}
```

### Correct Usage:

```javascript
try {
  // some code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
}
// Redirect outside of the try-catch block
redirect('/some-path')
```
