# App dir + MongoDB + TypeScript Example

## How to use

1. add your mongodb_uri (MONGODB_URI='http://db.com')
2. (Dev) yarn dev
3. Production yarn build & yarn start

## Description

### Model

The model in an application refers to the structure of the data. When used with MongoDB, a model represents the schema of the database. It defines what data should be stored in the database and the form and type of this data. In TypeScript, these models can be expressed as strongly-typed interfaces or classes. For instance, a user model might include fields like email, password, and creation date. Models are crucial for ensuring that the data conforms to a specified structure and type, which aids in maintaining data integrity and consistency.

### Route

Route refers to the endpoints of the application. It defines how the application responds to client requests on a specific path or URL. Routes are responsible for handling incoming requests and directing them to the appropriate logic for processing. In a typical web application, routes are mapped to different functionalities such as retrieving, creating, updating, or deleting resources. For example, in a RESTful API, you might have routes like /users for getting user data or /users with a POST method to create a new user.

### Service

The service layer in an application is where the business logic resides. This layer is responsible for processing data, handling business rules, and interacting with the database through models. Services act as an intermediary between the routes (which handle HTTP requests and responses) and the models (which interact with the database). The service layer's primary purpose is to execute specific business logic or computations. For example, in a user authentication service, the logic to verify user credentials and generate authentication tokens would reside here.
